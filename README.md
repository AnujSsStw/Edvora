# api limitatioins in this repo

Due to the the way the API is designed, there are a few limitations that must be considered when using the API.

1. `"map_url": "https://picsum.photos/200",` always returns the same image. And because of this, the API will not return a random image at the time of maping.

2. All the is SSR (Server Side Rendering) and the API will not return a random image at the time of maping.
